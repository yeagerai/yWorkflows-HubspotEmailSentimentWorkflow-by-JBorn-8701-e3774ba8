# Component Name

Hubspot Email Sentiment Workflow

# Description

The Hubspot Email Sentiment Workflow component is designed to process emails sent via Hubspot, analyze their sentiment, and apply appropriate templates based on the analysis. The component takes in email information, including the Hubspot API key and the email templates, and returns the modified email content.

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model

The input model, `HubspotEmailSentimentWorkflowIn`, consists of the following fields:

- `EmailId`: (str) The ID of the email to be processed.
- `HubspotApiKey`: (str) The API key used to access the Hubspot API.
- `NegativeTemplate`: (str) The email template to use if the email's sentiment is categorized as negative.
- `PositiveTemplate`: (str) The email template to use if the email's sentiment is categorized as positive.

## Output Model

The output model, `HubspotEmailSentimentWorkflowOut`, consists of the following field:

- `ResponseEmail`: (str) The processed email content.

Both input and output models use Pydantic's `BaseModel` for validation and serialization.

# Parameters

The component itself does not have any additional parameters beyond the input model fields specified above.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method in the `HubspotEmailSentimentWorkflow` class implements the following process:

1. Invoke the superclass `transform()` method, passing in the input arguments and callbacks.
2. Process the results obtained from the superclass method to generate the final `ResponseEmail` value. (This part of the code should be implemented by the developer)
3. Create an instance of the output model, `HubspotEmailSentimentWorkflowOut`, by passing the `ResponseEmail` value.
4. Return the output model instance.

# External Dependencies

The component requires several external libraries, including:

- `typing`: Provides type hints for better code readability and documentation.
- `dotenv`: Used to load environment variables.
- `fastapi`: Provides FastAPI functionality, which powers the endpoint for transforming emails.
- `pydantic`: Defines custom input and output models for the component and handles validation and serialization.

# API Calls

Although not explicitly implemented in the provided code, the Hubspot API is expected to be called to interact with the email data. The API key and email ID should be used to fetch email information for sentiment analysis and apply appropriate templates.

# Error Handling

As the `transform()` method is asynchronous, any errors that occur during its execution should be handled using `asyncio`'s exception handling mechanisms. Specific errors, such as those related to accessing the Hubspot API or processing email data, should include clear and descriptive error messages.

# Examples

The following is an example of how to use the `HubspotEmailSentimentWorkflow` component within a Yeager Workflow:
